This file documents user-visible changes in Couchbase clustering & UI.
======================================================================

-----------------------------------------
Between versions 1.8.0 and 1.8.1
-----------------------------------------

* ruby is not required anymore to build ns_server (and afaik rest of
  couchbase server)

* bucket deletion now waits for all nodes to complete deletion of
  bucket. But note there's timeout and it's set to 30 seconds.

* delete bucket request now correctly returns error during rebalance
  instead of crashing

* create bucket request now returns 503 instead of 400 during
  rebalance.

* bucket deletion errors are now correctly displayed on UI

* we're now using our own great logging library: ale. Formatting of
  log messages is greatly improved. With different log categories and
  separate log files for error and info (and above) levels. So that
  high-level and important messages are preserved longer without
  compromising detailedness of debug logs. A lot of improvements to
  quality of logged messages were made. Another user-visible change is
  much faster grabbing of logs.

* couchbase_server script now implements reliable
  shutdown. I.e. couchbase_server -k will gracefully shutdown server
  persisting all pending mutations before exiting. Actual service stop
  invocation is synchronous.

* during rebalance vbucket map is now updated after each vbucket
  move. Providing better guide for (perhaps not so) smart clients.

* new-style mb_master transition grace period is now over. 1.8.1 can
  coexist (and support online upgrade from) membase 1.7.2 and
  above. Versions before that are not supported because they don't
  support new-style master election.

* (MB-4554) stats gathering is now using wall clock time instead of
  erlang's now function. erlang:now is based on wall clock time, but
  by definition cannot jump backwards. So certain ntp time adjustments
  caused issues for stats gathering previously.

* scary looking retry_not_ready_vbuckets log message was
  fixed. ebucketmigrator process can sometimes restart itself when
  some of it's source vbucket were not ready when replication was
  started. That restart was looking like crash. Now it's fixed.

* vbucket map generation code now generates maps with optimal "moves"
  from current map in the following important cases. When adding back
  previously failed over node (assuming every other node is same and
  healthy) and when performing "swap rebalance". Swap rebalance is
  when you simultaneously add and remove N nodes. Where N can be any
  natural number (up to current cluster size of course). Rebalance is
  now significantly faster when this conditions apply.

* (MB-4476) couchbase server now support node cloning better. You can
  use clone snapshot of empty node and join those VMs into single
  cluster.

* couchbase server is not more robust when somebody tries to create
  bucket when bucket with same name is still being shut down on any of
  nodes

* annoying and repeating log message when there is memcached type
  buckets, but some nodes are not yet rebalanced it is now fixed

* bug causing couchbase to return 500 error instead of gracefully
  returning error when bucket parameter "name" is missing is now fixed

* few races when node that orchestrates rebalance is being rebalanced
  out are now fixed. Previously it was possible to see rebalance as
  running and other 'rebalance-in-flight' config effects when it was
  actually completed.

* bug causing failed over node to not delete it's data files was
  fixed. Note: previously it was only possible when node was added back
  after being failed over.

* couchbase server now performs rebalance more safely. It builds new
  replicas before switching to them. It's not completely safe to stop
  rebalance at any point without risking data loss

* due to safer rebalance we're now deleting old vbuckets as soon as
  possible during rebalance. Making further vbucket movements faster

* couchbase server avoids reuse of tap names. Previous versions had
  release notes that recommended to avoid rebalancing for 5 minutes
  after stopped or failed rebalance. That problem is now fixed.

* (MB-4906 Always fetch autofailover count from config) bug when
  certain sequence of events could lead to autofailover breaking it's
  limit of single node to fail over was fixed

* (MB-4963) old "issue" of UI reporting rebalance as failed when it
  was in fact stopped by user is now fixed

* (MB-5020) bug causing rebalance to be incorrectly displayed as
  running preventing failover was fixed

* (MB-4023) couchbase server now using dedicated memcached port for
  it's own stats gathering, orchestration, replication and
  rebalance. Making it more robust against mis-configured clients.

* /diag/masterEvents cluster events streaming facility was
  implemented. See doc/master-events.txt for more details.

* (MB-4564) during failover and rebalance out couchbase server now
  leaves data files. So that accident failover does not leads to
  catastrophic data loss. Those files are deleted when node is
  rebalanced back in or becomes independent single-node cluster.

* (MB-4967) couchbase_num_vbuckets_default ns_config variable (absent
  by default) can now be used to change number of vbuckets for any
  couchbase buckets created after that change. The only way to change
  it is via /diag/eval.

* mastership takeover is now clearly logged

* (MB-4960) mem_used and some other stats are now displayed on UI

* (MB-5050) autofailover service is now aware that it's not possible
  to fail over during rebalance

* (MB-5063) couchbase server now disallows attempts to rebalance out
  unknown nodes instead of misbehaving

* (MB-5019) bug when create bucket dialog was displaying incorrect
  remaining quote right after bucket deletion is now fixed

* internal cluster management stats counters facility was
  implemented. The only way so far to see those stats is in diags or
  by posting 'system_stats_collector:get_ns_server_stats().' to
  /diag/eval. So far only few stats related to reliable replica
  building during rebalance are gathered.

* diags now have tap & checkpoint stats from memcached on all nodes

* local tap & checkpoints stats are now logged after rebalance and
  each 30 seconds during rebalance

* (MB-5256) but with alert not being generated for failures to save
  item mutatins to disk was fixed

* (MB-5275) bug with alerts not being shown to user sometimes was fixed

* (MB-5408) ns_memcached now implements smarter queuing and
  prioritization of heavy & light operations. Leading to hopefully
  much less memcached timeouts. Particularly vbucket delete operation
  is known to be heavy. By running it on separate worker we allow
  stats requests to be performed without delays and thus hopefully
  without hitting timeouts.

* simple facility to adjust some timeouts at runtime was
  implemented. Example, usage is this diag/eval snippet:
    ns_config:set({node, node(), {timeout, ns_memcached_outer_very_heavy}}, 120000).
  Which will bump timeout for most heavy ns_memcached calls up to 120
  seconds (most timeouts are in milliseconds)

* config replication was improved to avoid avalanche of config NxN
  replications caused by incoming config replications. Now only
  locally produced replications are forcefully pushed to all
  nodes. Note: old random gossip is still there. As well as somewhat
  excessive full config push & pull to newly discovered node(s).

* it's now possible to change max concurrent rebalance movers
  count. Post the following to /diag/eval to set it to 4:
    ns_config:set(rebalance_moves_per_node, 4).
